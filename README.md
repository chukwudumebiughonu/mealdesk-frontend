## Data Flow

1. User actions in the frontend components trigger API calls using custom hooks (e.g., `useCreateMyRestaurant`, `useGetMyUser`).
2. These hooks use React Query for data fetching and caching.
3. API requests are sent to the backend Express.js server.
4. The backend processes requests, interacts with the MongoDB database using Mongoose models, and returns responses.
5. The frontend updates its state based on the responses, providing real-time updates to the user interface.
